## General info
The app is getting data from the `data.js` file with properties: 
- id
- title
- category
- price
- img and
- desc
## Functionality
All buttons are dynamic and their number and text depend on `category` which comes from `allCategories` array and would be changed using the function to be added to the list of categories. The menu is filtered based on clicked `category` and if you want to see the whole list, press `All` button.
